The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Arbitration proceedings will be held in Ahmedabad-Gujarat, India. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand Rupee (Rs. 5,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Five Thousand Rupee (Rs. 5,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
